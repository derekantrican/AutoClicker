This is a 100% FREE simple auto-clicker program. This was written to provide a free alternative to paid auto clickers that might exist.

This program currently supports 4 types of actions:
- Click (left/middle/right) at a specified location
- Mouse move between two locations
- Wait for a number of milliseconds
- Image validation (validate an area on the screen against a pre-defined, expected image)

Some extra features this tool provides (beyond what is normally available in typical auto-clickers):
- Mouse click, mouse move, and wait actions all have a "variance" property that can be set. This allows the actions to be a little bit more random and not as easily detectable
- Mouse movements are controlled by the [WindMouse algorithm](https://ben.land/post/2021/04/25/windmouse-human-mouse-movement/) - a algorithm providing more human-like mouse movement
- Save & load a list of actions - allow you to save & restore your list of actions
- Save the target window size & position with the list of actions (when you load the list of actions, the program will check the target window and move & resize it to match what was used last)
- This program is 100% FREE!! Many other similar programs charge a fee for large amounts of actions or saving the list of actions or other features. This program does not charge for anything. At all.
